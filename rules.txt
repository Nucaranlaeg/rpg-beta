# Actions

On your turn, you may take one action of each type.  If an action is divisible (such as making multiple attacks or moving a distance) you may order what you do however you like.

Any Move action can be taken as a Standard action.  Any Swift action may be taken as a Move or a Standard action.

Standard:
	- Attack: Make an attack.
	- Spell: Cast a spell.
	- 
Move:
	- Walk: Move a distance up to your speed.
	- Run: Move a distance up to double your speed.  You grant Advantage to attackers until the beginning of your next turn.
Swift:
	- Draw one or more weapons
	- Channel: Gain 1 mana

# Mana

You may channel as a swift action three times plus your intelligence modifier per day, but only once per turn.  Add half of your total levels in classes which grant a magic source (rounded down) to the number of times per day you can channel.  For example, a level 5 Wizard with 16 intelligence can channel 3 + 3 (5/2) + 3 (Int) = 9 times per day.

# Levelling up

Each class has 4 associated stats.  Each time you level up, gain one point in one of the stats associated with the class you levelled up in.  You may only choose the same stat once every three levels, regardless of which class or classes you choose.

Gain one skill.


# Wounds, Death and Dying

When a creature takes damage, that creature may also take one or more Wounds.  A creature's hit points may be reduced to 0 (but never below), and this does not affect their capabilities in any way - hit points are a representation of a creature's combined luck and skill to avoid injury.  Wounds are calculated in the following way:

- First, if the damage dealt is greater than the creature's Constitution *score*, subtract the creature's Constitution score from the damage dealt and the creature will take a Wound.  For example, an ogre hits a player character with 10 Constitution for 12 damage.  The character takes 1 Wound and loses 2 hit points.

- Second, if the damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, divide the excess damage by the creature's Constitution score, rounding any remainder up.  The creature takes that many Wounds.  For example, an ogre hits a player character with 8 Constitution for 18 damage, but the character only has 1 hit point remaining.  8 damage causes 1 Wound, 1 more damage reduces the character to 0 hit points, and the remaining 9 damage causes 2 more Wounds, for a total of 3 Wounds.

- Some other effects may cause additional Wounds.  For instance, critical hits always deal 1 additional Wound.

If a creature takes more than one Wound from a single attack or takes a Wound from an attack that leaves it at 0 hit points, that creature must make a death saving throw or fall unconscious and begin dying.  Note that multiple Wounding attacks from one creature on its turn may not require any death saving throws, provided they only deal one Wound each.  The DC of a death saving throw is always equal to the number of Wounds that a creature has taken.  A creature gets a bonus on their death saving throw equal to their Constitution modifier.  A natural 1 is not neccessarily a failure on a death saving throw - so you are not required to roll death saving throws if you have not taken Wounds equal to your Constitution modifier plus two or more.

When a creature is dying at the beginning of their turn, they must roll a death saving throw.  The results are as follows:

- DC - 6 or worse: the creature dies.

- DC - 5 to DC - 1: the creature gains an additional Wound.

- DC to DC + 4: no change.

- DC + 5 to DC + 9: the creature becomes stable and no longer rolls death saving throws unless it takes another Wound.  It will awaken in 1d4 hours.

- DC + 10 or better: the creature becomes stable and conscious.

A natural 20 always stabilizes the creature, and if the result is at least DC + 5, the creature becomes conscious.

When a dying creature recieves magical healing, they may immediately roll a death saving throw.  This special death saving throw has no consequences if it is a failure, but it can stabilize the creature or cause it to become conscious (even if it is already stable).  Note that even with magical healing, a creature may still be dying, and will continue rolling death saving throws at the beginning of each of its turns.

All hit points are restored after a short break of 15 minutes spent relaxing or 30 minutes of easy travel.

## Long Term Healing

Each night that you rest, you heal one Wound.  However, you may still die from your injuries.  If you are Wounded when you begin your rest, then at the midpoint of your rest, roll a death saving throw.  If you fail it you begin dying, but only roll once per hour and do not wake up from results that say you do.  Provided you do not die, you stop dying and wake up in the morning as usual (for a typical 8 hour rest, you would roll a maximum of 5 times per night).

You may hire a nurse to watch over you through the night; one nurse can watch over up to 10 creatures and reduces the maximum number of death saves to 2 per night.

## Less Deadly Games

Some groups might prefer a less deadly game at higher levels.  If your group desires a less deadly game, consider one of the following options:

- Player characters cannot die from failed death saving throws if they have fewer wounds than their level plus their Constitution modifier (don't subtract a malus).

- Player characters do not roll death saving throws if they have fewer wounds than their level plus their Constitution modifier (don't subtract a malus).

- Player characters add half their level to death saving throws.

## Typical Reactions to Wounds

Different creatures vary in their reactions to being Wounded, but most will not fight to the death.  Animals will flee after taking Wounds equal to their Constitution score (the presence of a pack or young may alter this), and almost all beasts will flee before they reach Constitution + 10 Wounds.  Intelligent creatures who are not Evil may hesitate to attack unconscious creatures unless players have done so.

Undead creatures and constructs are destroyed on their first failed death saving throw, but they are immune to critical hits.
