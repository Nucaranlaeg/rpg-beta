## Typical Reactions to Wounds

Different creatures vary in their reactions to being Wounded, but most will not fight to the death.  Animals will flee after taking Wounds equal to their Constitution score (the presence of a pack or young may alter this), and almost all beasts will flee before they reach Constitution + 10 Wounds.  Intelligent creatures who are not Evil may hesitate to attack unconscious creatures unless players have done so.

Undead creatures and constructs are destroyed on their first failed death saving throw, but they are immune to critical hits.
