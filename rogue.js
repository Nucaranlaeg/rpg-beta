	"All": [
		"Reaching level 5, 10, 15, and 20 in this class allows you to attack one additional time when you use your standard action to attack.  You may sacrifice one of your attacks gained this way to get Advantage on one of your attacks.",

	"Level 1": [
		"Precision - When you have Advantage on an attack and the lower die would hit, the attack deals one extra wound.",
	],
	"Rogue": [
		"Good Aim - When you have Advantage on an attack, add 5 to the lower die before determining which die to take.  This cannot result in a roll greater than 20 and does not cause critical hits if the original value would not be a critical hit.",
		"Lethal Strike - Whenever you deal a wound to a creature with Precision, that creature must make a death saving throw or fall unconscious as if it had taken two or more wounds.  The creature has a penalty on this save equal to your total Advantage on the attack.",
		"Accuracy - When you do not have any Advantage on an attack, you gain Advantage (but cannot use Precision on that attack).",
		"Constant Threat - If you would have Advantage on an attack, you may choose not to roll to hit and just do damage as though you had hit.  If you do, that damage cannot cause the target to take any wounds.",

	"General": [
		"Hidden Blade - When you miss an attack against a creature who does not know your location, you may immediately attempt a <STEALTH CHECK> as a free action to remain hidden.",
		"Slip Away - When an ally hits an adjacent enemy with an attack, you may use a reaction to move your speed without provoking an attack of opportunity from the hit creature.",
		"Combat Reflexes (Rogue) - You may take additional reactions each round up to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1 extra reaction).  Each extra reaction may only be used to activate a Rogue feature.",
		"Slippery - When an enemy misses you with an attack, you may use a reaction to impose Disadvantage on attacks they make against you before the end of your next turn.",
