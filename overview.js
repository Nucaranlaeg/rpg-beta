If you only choose features from your class, you should be fine, but it is okay to choose features from other classes to make your character play the way you want him to.
		Your skills are more fluid - you can choose things which fit your character and apply them where appropriate.`,

		When you have Advantage, you roll 2d20 and take the higher value. When you have Disadvantage, you take the lower value instead.
		Subtract your Disadvantage (-D) from your Advantage (+A) before rolling - if you have +A and -D they cancel out and you make a normal roll. If you have net +2A or better, add your net Advantage to your roll (or conversely, subtract your Disadvantage).`,
