		"Target - (Any) By taking the time required to line up a shot, you gain Advantage on one attack.  If you could otherwise make more than one attack, instead roll your damage dice one additional time for each attack you do not make.  For instance, a level 10 Archer could normally make 3 attacks for 1d8+3 damage would do 3d8+3 damage on a hit.",

		"Weak Spot - When you score a critical hit with a ranged weapon, you can choose to double the damage you deal instead of scoring a wound (if the attack would normally deal 2d6+2, you may deal 4d6+4 on a critical hit).",
		"Bull's Eye - Your critical threat range is increased by 1 plus your total Advantage (Disadvantage does not decrease your critical threat range).",
		"Multishot - You can fire or throw two pieces of ammunition at once.  Decrease your maximum range to 30 feet and suffer Disadvantage on your attacks, but roll two attacks each time you attack.  You may only use this to attack with weapons for which two could plausibly fit in your hand.",
