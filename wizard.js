		"Arcane Preparation - Once per hour, you may prepare a spell.  This takes 5 minutes of concentration (you must use your standard action each turn to concentrate on the preparation).  Choose one spell you can cast.  You may cast it once without channelling or paying any mana cost, and it is treated as though you spent mana on it equal the mana you gain from channelling once.  If you prepare a new spell, the old spell is lost.",

Choose a second School of magic to be forbidden to you.  You forget all spells you know of that School and may never again learn a spell from that School.  Learn two spells from Schools you specialize in.  You may choose this feature multiple times, but must select different Schools each time.",
