		"Arcane Preparation - Once per hour, you may prepare a spell.  This takes 5 minutes of concentration (you must use your standard action each turn to concentrate on the preparation).  Choose one spell you can cast.  You may cast it once without channelling or paying any mana cost, and it is treated as though you spent mana on it equal to one turns' worth of channelling.  If you prepare a new spell, the old spell is lost.",

		"Intense Preparation - You can pack more mana into your prepared spells.  Your prepared spells are considered to have one additional mana spent on them.",
		"Hair Trigger - You may cast your prepared spell as a reaction to being attacked or a creature entering a space adjacent to you as long as its normal casting time is no more than one action and you are not flat-footed.",
		"Conduit - Increase the maximum mana you can apply to a spell by one third of your Wizard level (rounded up).",
		"Bend the Weave - If you cast a spell with a mana cost of at least twice your channel amount, your next Counterspell within 1 minute has its effective mana cost increased by 1.",

Choose a second School of magic to be forbidden to you.  You forget all spells you know of that School and may never again learn a spell from that School.  Learn two spells from one of your specialized Schools.  You may choose this feature multiple times, but must select different Schools each time.",
