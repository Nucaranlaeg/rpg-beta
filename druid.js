		"Wild Shape - As a swift action, you may change your shape to that of a beast, provided you have not been Wild Shaped in the last hour.  While you are in the shape of a beast, you may use a swift action to regain your normal form.  The beast you choose must be <b>Appropriate Challenge Rating</b>, and must be within 1 size class of you.  Wounds carry over between forms, and if you fall unconscious (including by sleeping) you revert back to your normal form.  You may not channel while Wild Shaped, but you may still cast spells.\nWhen you are Wild Shaped, your physical attributes become those of the beast, potentially increasing your maximum and current hit points (in addition to other effects).\nWorked metal does not transform with you and may be destroyed by the transformation depending on your new form (coins are cast, so they do transform). Every other part of your gear transforms with you and is unavailable until you return to your normal form.",

		"Restore the Body - When you return to your normal form, you may heal 1 Wound if you were Wounded while you were Wild Shaped. Overchannelling does not count as being Wounded for this feature.",
		"Natural Magic - You can channel while Wild Shaped, but it counts as two against your daily limit.",
		"Instincts - When you Wild Shape into a beast with natural abilities, choose one of them and you gain it as long as you are in that shape. You may choose this feature multiple times, increasing the maximum number of natural abilities you gain access to. Non-standard movement speeds count as abilities for this purpose.",
		"Animal Friendship - Small and smaller beasts do not perceive you as a threat. You can coexist peacefully with larger animals, but ones you have not met before may be aggressive on your first meeting. Purposefully harming an animal that is friendly to you robs you of your natural serenity until the next full moon.",
