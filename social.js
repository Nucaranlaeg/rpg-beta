		body: `Each creature is one of Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. Similarly, each creature is Good, Neutral, or Evil. For many creatures this is their nature and - while they may be coerced to act in a different way - their nature is unchanging. These are the unthinking beasts as well as monsters created for servitude by the gods.The mortal races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, _, _) are not constrained by their nature and while they have certain tendencies those are tempered by their experiences. Their natures are also less absolute; no elf or dwarf is truly Good all the time - nor Evil.
		For player characters, their alignment is not fixed but revealed over time as the game is played. Each level (including level 1), each character gains one point of Reputation: Honour (Law), Glory (Good), Infamy (Evil), or Notoriety (Chaos).
		There exist various magics capable of detecting and preferentially affecting those of certain alignments. A character is Lawful if she has at least one Honour and more Honour than Notoriety, and similar for other alignments. Once a character has at least six Honour and Notoriety combined, she must have two more Notoriety than Honour to be Chaotic (and vice versa). If a character is neither Good nor Evil, she is Neutral on that scale, and a character who is neither Lawful nor Chaotic is Neutral on that scale.
		For example, a character with 2 Honour, 1 Glory, and 4 Notoriety is Chaotic Good, while a character with 2 Infamy and 1 Honour is Lawful Evil.
		When making a skill check in the Social category, you add the amount of relevant reputation to your check. Your DM makes the final call for which alignment you add, but your roleplay influences this determination. Your reputation goes before you: you don't add Glory when you're trying to convince someone that you're Good; you add Glory when you're trying to convince someone to agree with you because you're Good. This applies even in far-off lands you've never been to before, as your alignment has metaphysical reality.
		Your bonus from Reputation on any check cannot be greater than three quarters of your level, rounded up.`,

If you still have another Reputation to gain, have the other players vote again. Handle tied votes by either both choices being available or having the DM break ties.
