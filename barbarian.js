	"Level 1": [
		"Rage - You may enter a rage, gaining +4 strength and +4 constitution, but taking a -2 penalty to AC.  Your rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to half of your (newly-improved) constitution score, rounded down.  You may rage once per hour.  Your rage ends early if you fall unconscious, or you may end it as a free action on your turn.  When you begin raging, you may select a rage modifier you know and gain its benefits the entire time you are raging.",

	"Rage Modifier": [
		"Undying - Whenever you roll a death saving throw while raging, you may choose to treat the roll as a 20 (after seeing the roll).  If you use this feature, you must immediately make a death saving throw when your rage ends.",

		"Reckless - Whenever you attack during this rage, you gain a bonus to your attack roll up to your level.  Until the end of your next turn, you take a penalty to your AC equal to the bonus.  If you use this feature multiple times in one turn, only the greatest penalty applies.",
		"Painless - Whenever you would take a wound, you may instead lose hit points equal to half of your constitution score.  Whenever you take damage, you may reduce that damage by your constitution score and take a wound instead.  You may only use this feature once per instance of damage.",
		"Furious - Whenever you miss, you gain Advantage on your next attack against the same target until the end of your next turn.",
		"Indomitable - You are immune to all mind-affecting status effects and spells.  You have Advantage on saves against illusions.  You still take psychic damage (including from mind-affecting spells), but only half.  Allies within 30 feet of you have Advantage on saves against fear effects.",
		"Mighty - You gain an additional +4 strength, and Advantage on all strength-based skill checks.",

	"General": [
		"Cleave - If you cause a creature to fall unconscious or die when you hit them with a melee weapon, you can immediately make an additional attack against a different creature with the same weapon.",
		"Muscled Around - When you deal damage with a melee attack with a heavy weapon to a creature no more than one size class greater than you, you may move that creature 5 feet in any direction.",
		"Fearsome Charge - You can charge by moving at least 20 feet in a straight line toward your target.  If your target is an enemy, you gain Advantage on all melee attacks against it until the end of your turn.  If it is an object, your melee attacks bypass its damage reduction until the end of your turn.",
		"Brutality - Before rolling for an attack, you may forfeit all Advantage you have against your target for this attack.  If you do, you roll extra damage dice equal to your weapon's base damage dice for each Advantage forfeit.",
		"Quick to the Fight - Your speed increases by 10 feet.  If you attack one or more enemies, your speed increases by another 10 feet until the end of your next turn.",
		"Invulnerable - Reduce all damage you take by 3.",
		"Healthy - Your constitution score is increased by 3 for the purposes of wounds.",
		"Fearful Presence - Once per hour on your turn, you can intimidate creatures near you by your sheer presence.  This is a free action.  Creatures within 30 feet who can see you must make a Wisdom save with DC 10 plus your strength modifier or become frightened for 1 minute.",
		"Tireless - You are treated as having 2 fewer stacks of exhaustion (but not less than 0).  You lose one additional stack of exhaustion when you take a long rest.",
		"Outlast - When you fail a physical check or save by 5 or less, you may gain a stack of exhaustion to succeed on it instead.",
		"Unarmoured Defense - When you wear light or no armour, gain bonus AC equal to your Wisdom modifier.  You lose this bonus any time you would be denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, even if your Dexterity modifier is 0 or lower.",
