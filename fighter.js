		"Martial Stance - As a swift action on your turn, you may select any Stance that you know and adopt it.  You immediately gain its benefits and lose the benefits of your previous Stance.  You may choose the same Stance you are currently in, and you may leave a Stance as a free action on your turn.  You immediately fall out of a Stance if you fall unconscious.",
	],
	"Stance": [
		"Hold the Line - When you enter this Stance, choose a direction.  Creatures which enter your threatened squares against that direction provoke attacks of opportunity from you.  If you deal damage with this attack of opportunity, the creature that triggered it cannot continue moving in the chosen direction this turn.  For example, if you choose North it affects movement from the North, North-West, and North-East, and if you choose South-West it affects movement from the South-West, South, and West.",
		"Bodyguard - When you enter this Stance, choose an adjacent creature.  That creature gains 2 AC, and whenever it would take damage, each of you instead takes half (it rounds up, you round down).  If that creature moves to a space that is not adjacent to you, you immediately fall out of this Stance.  If you are mounted, you may select your mount.",
		"Harass - You continually take Advantage of openings which your enemies provide.  If a creature in a space you threaten takes damage from an attack or spell from anyone other than you, you may immediately deal damage to that creature equal to half of your Dexterity modifier, rounded up (minimum 1).  This damage can never cause a wound.",
		"Brace - While in this Stance, if you take a wound due to damage from an attack or spell, reduce the remaining damage by your Constitution modifier.  This may happen more than once if an attack deals more than one wound.  The first time you take damage while in this Stance, reduce that damage by your Constitution score (but not by more than half).",
		"Advance - While in this Stance, if you deal damage to a creature your size or smaller with an attack you may also push the creature 5 feet directly away from you.  If you push a creature, you may move 5 feet toward it as part of the attack (doing so provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, but not from the creature pushed).  You may push creatures one size class larger than you if you deal a wound with an attack.  You may push any size of creature if you deal two or more wounds with an attack.  A creature may fall prone to avoid being pushed.",
		"Duel - When you enter this Stance, choose a creature.  You gain Advantage against on attacks against that creature and on saves that it causes you to make.  You grant Advantage to all other creatures that attack you.  Whenever it attacks a creature other than you, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you.",
		"Hammer and Chisel - While in this Stance, the damage from all of your attacks against a creature on your turn is added together before how many wounds the creature takes is calculated and is treated as a single attack for the purposes of damage reduction.  When you hit a creature with an attack, your subsequent attacks against that creature this round deal an additional 2 damage.  This damage stacks.",
	],
	"General": [
		"Combat Reflexes - You may take additional reactions each round up to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1 extra reaction).  Each extra reaction may only be used to make an attack of opportunity.",
		"Martial Tempo - When you use your standard action to attack, you may attack one fewer times than usual but also gain the benefit of the Ready action.  You may only use this to Ready a single attack.",
		"Armour Mastery - If your armour restricts the maximum Dexterity bonus you may apply to your AC, increase the maximum Dexterity bonus you may apply to your AC by 2.",
		"Steelclad - While wearing heavy armour, you may ignore the first wound you take each hour.",
		"Invulnerable - While wearing medium or heavy armour, reduce all damage you take by 3.",
		"Tactical Mind - If you have gained Advantage on an attack against a creature due to flanking since the beginning of your last turn, you are treated as still flanking that creature.",
		"Battlemaster - As a swift action on your turn, you may allow one of your allies within 30 feet to move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.  That ally must be able to see a hand signal or hear a command you give them.",
		"Ambidextrous - You may wield an offhand weapon without penalty as long as it is light.",
		"Dangerous - Enemies you threaten cannot flank your allies unless they also flank you.  You and your flanking allies deal an additional 2 damage whenever either of you hit creatures you both flank.",
		"Lunge - When you take a Readied action to make a single attack, you may first move 5 feet.  This does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you attack.",
